            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <article>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of programming concepts.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with basic programming constructs like variables, loops, and functions.</li>
                    <li>Some experience with another programming language is beneficial but not required.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <article>
                <p>To get started with Python, you can write a simple "Hello World" program. Open a Python interpreter or create a Python script and write the following code:</p>
                <code>
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>In Python, variables are used to store and represent data. Variable names follow certain rules:

                    A variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_), followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
                    Python is case-sensitive, so "myVar" and "myvar" are different variables.
                    You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=). For example:</p>
                <code>x = 42</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python supports various data types, including:
                    <strong>Numeric types:</strong><code>int, float, complex</code>
                    <strong>Text type:</strong><code>str</code> 
                    <strong>Boolean type:</strong><code>bool</code>
                    <strong>Sequence types:</strong><code>list, tuple, range</code>
                    <strong>Mapping type:</strong><code>dict</code>
                    <strong>Set types:</strong><code>set, frozenset</code>
                    <strong>NoneType:</strong><code>None</code>
                    Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type explicitly.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Statements_(if...else)">
            <header>Conditional Statements (if...else)</header>
            <article>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a block of code if a condition is true. You can also use the optional else clause to execute code when the condition is false. Example:</p>
                <pre><code>
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
                </code></pre>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Loops_(while_and_for)">
            <header>Loops (while and for)</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python supports both while and for loops. The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true. Example:</p>
                <pre><code>
n = 0
while n < 3:
    print(n)
    n += 1
                </code></pre>
                <p>The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string). Example:</p>
                <pre><code>
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
                </code></pre>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <article>
                <p>A function in Python is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and a colon. Example:</p>
                <code>
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
                </code></pre>
                <p>You can call the function by passing arguments:</p>
                <code>
                    greet("World")
                </code>
                <p>This will print "Hello, World!".</p>
